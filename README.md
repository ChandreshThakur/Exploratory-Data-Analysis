# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This notbook  solves an interesting problem of Data Science domain, Where Problem is defined like that of industry standards, (somewhat)

### Problem statement:

You have applied for the post of a Data Scientist (DS) at FitCo Pvt. Ltd., a company with a pan-India presence, and engaged in the manufacture, marketing, sales, and support of fitness equipment. With Indians focussing on fitness goals, the company has been growing steadily since the Pandemic. As per the advertisement for the DS post, it now wants to introduce and emphasize data orientation in all its activities. The company’s Marketing and Sales Head is tasked with the responsibility of building the team of Data Scientists and Analysts.

On the day of the interview the Head addresses the candidates as follows: 

> “We are giving you one of the files - `fitco.csv` - from our data archives. See what best you can do with it! It contains the total sales value (Sales), and unit Sales price (SellingPrice) related to the sales of some of our products. It also tells us if any product return happened related to a particular sale. We always wanted tools to help us predict the total sales value of our products given their SellingPrice. We would also like to know if product returns are likely at selected price points. Can you help create this capability?”

He further sheepishly said, 

> “But, you know, I really do not know how many products’ data is captured in this file!”

He continued, 

> “BTW, there is some relevant information for you. For some of the products we followed pricing policies that were different for Class-A cities as compared with the other towns and cities. People in Class-A cities showed some weird purchasing behaviour!”

Finally, he said, 

> “And one more point, while my team will be interested in reviewing and understanding your code, I will need complete, detailed, and good explanation of your approach, steps and analysis. It should be thorough, and amply supported with plots, tables and appropriate explanations. I’ve heard about many undesirable behaviours of ML models – you will have to convince me that your models are the best, well behaved, and reliable!”

He continued: 

> “Once you develop the required models, see if you can provide us the following information: for SellingPrice ranging between Rs 60 and Rs 150, incremented at Rs 5, predict the product(s) sales value at each selling price, and also let us know if any product ‘returns’ can be expected at those price points. It will be nice if you can create Table(s) and plot(s) to illustrate the results, and explain them.”

> “Wish you the very best, all of you”
